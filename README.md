# http-over-nats example

This is a simple example of how to use the `http-over-nats` package to create a simple HTTP client that listens on a 
NATS subject for incoming requests. This is not a library, you're meant to copy, paste and adapt it to your needs. You 
shouldn't add dependencies to your code for trivial stuff like this anyway.
